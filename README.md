# connect4
This project is from my Engineering 1181 class at the Ohio State University. For the project I created a basic connect 4 game in Matlab. 

To play my connect 4 game you need to download the "connect4.m", "simpleGameEngine.m", and "ConnectFour.png". The "connect4.m" file was created by me and is the code behind this game. The "simpleGameEngine.m" provides graphic for this game. If you redistribute the "simpleGameEngine.m" file, you must retain the copyright notice. The "ConnectFour.png" file contains an empty sprite, red sprite, and black sprite that will be used in the game.
